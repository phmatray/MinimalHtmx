## Overview 🌐

This template includes:

- 2 Blazor components (`PageCounter` and `PageContact`) with HTMX integration for building dynamic, server-side pages.
- Carter-based routing to handle minimal APIs seamlessly.
- Pre-configured HTMX components (`HxCounter`, `HxContact` and `HxContactEdit`) to handle server-side rendering and interactivity.
- A clean, minimal structure that supports server-side HTML updates without JavaScript.

## Features ✨

- **HTMX Integration**: Use HTMX to enable dynamic HTML updates without JavaScript, leveraging server-side interactions.
- **Carter Routing**: Minimal API routing using Carter makes defining API routes simple and clean.
- **Blazor Components**: Blazor components are used to encapsulate the UI, supporting easy reuse and testing.
- **.NET 8 Support**: Built to target .NET 8.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and enhancements.
- **Form Handling**: Use `hx-put` and `hx-get` to enable form binding and server-side state management.

## Installation ⚙️

Install the template using the `dotnet new` command:

```bash
dotnet new install Atypical.MinimalHtmx.Templates
```

## Usage 📑

Create a new project using the template:

```bash
dotnet new minimalhtmx -n YourProjectName
```

This command creates a new directory named `YourProjectName` with the template contents.

### Running the Project ▶️

Once the project is created, navigate to the directory and run the application:

```bash
cd YourProjectName
dotnet run
```

The project will be available at `https://localhost:{PORT}` by default.

## Project Structure 🏗️

- `Pages/Counter/PageCounter.razor`: Main Blazor component to display a counter.
- `Pages/Counter/PageCounter.razor.cs`: Defines API endpoints using Carter to handle GET and POST requests for counter data.
- `Pages/Counter/HxCounter.razor`: HTMX-enabled component that displays a counter.
- `Pages/Contact/PageContact.razor`: Main Blazor component to display a contact.
- `Pages/Contact/PageContact.razor.cs`: Defines API endpoints using Carter to handle GET and PUT requests for contact data.
- `Pages/Contact/HxContact.razor`: HTMX-enabled component that displays a contact's details.
- `Pages/Contact/HxContactEdit.razor`: HTMX-enabled edit form for contacts.
- `Store/AppState.cs`: Stores the state of the application, including contact details.

## Customization ✏️

### Adding New Routes ➕

To add new routes, modify the `AddRoutes` method in `PageContact.cs`. You can define new GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE endpoints using Carter's fluent routing API.

```csharp
public void AddRoutes(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
{
    var group = app.MapGroup("htmx/contact");
    group.MapGet("/{Id:int}", HandleGet);
    group.MapPut("/{Id:int}", HandlePut);
    group.MapPost("/new", HandleCreateNew);
}
```

### Modifying Components 🛠️

Components are located by feature in the `Pages` folder. You can edit `HxContact.razor` and `HxContactEdit.razor` to change the UI and behavior of the contact display and edit functionality.

### Using AppState 💾

`AppState.cs` is used to store the state of your application, such as contact details. You can extend `AppState` to hold more data as your application grows.
